Project Description:
* The goal of this project is to rehaul the current Budget Generator that the AgEcon department currently uses. Their current software was last updated in 2008 and they have no way to edit the code, so if this Budget Generator breaks they have no way of fixing it. We plan to use a variety of resources to make this project perform as best as possible for the user. We will begin with a user-friendly UI/UX design and implement this design with Html5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and Javascript. These languages seem to be industry standard and/or easy to use, so it will allow our team to make this project with ease while expanding our programming library. Additionally, we plan to use Sqlite to be our database management system because it does not require a dedicated server while still storing all the users' data. We hope this project will help each of our members grow as a software engineering student and create a better understanding of the webpage application development process and the aspects that come with it. We also plan to acquire a better understanding of each coding language we plan to use and how these languages intertwine with each other. Furthermore, our team plans to develop a better understanding of Github and its in's and out's because it is an established website where professionals can commute with other programmers without having to meet in person. Github is used by some of the biggest tech companies like Google and Amazon, and it would be very beneficial for us to learn. Our team is excited about this project and are ready for any challenge that comes our way.

Coding languges to be used:
* front-end: html/css/php
* back-end: postgresql
